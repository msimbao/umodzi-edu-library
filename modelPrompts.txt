follow this format to make a model ecz exam: dictionary with the following keys and variable types: id (string), title (string), subject (string), grade (number), cost (number), description (string), difficulty (string), totalQuestions (number), estimatedTime (number), link (string), questions (array of dictionaries).

the id should be a unique string made by combining the date first three letters of subject grade and number after a dash if making multiple dictionaries e.g 20252107MATG7_1

the title should be short and concise and unique

the link should be a url that is: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msimbao/umodzi-edu-library/refs/heads/main/tests/grade{grade}/{subject}/files/{id}.json" where {grade} {subject} and {id} are the ones you will put in the dictionary.

Questions should be an array of dictionaries with keys and types: id (question number starting at 1 if it is a question, if it is a non_question like a section give it a name), questions (string), options (array of strings), image( can be blank or a string of a prompt of an image that should be there),answer (number index of correct answer), explanation (string). 

some questions should have the keys non_question=true if they are not questions but instead intermission sections explaining what questions are up next or the comprehension passage before a set of follow up questions. These questions should not count towards the total question count when you are making them and their ids will just be a name.

some questions are follow up quesitons that need to follow each other or follow the comprehension passage and should have the key follow_up=true

if you need to make some parts bold, put the words between double asterisks, e.g **Bold text**. If you need to underline some words, put the words between double bottom dashes, e.g __underline__. If you need to make a blank space, use 3 dots, e.g ...

the first question should always be a non_question with the summary of the quiz you are about to take.

a few questions should have images to mimic how actual past papers are made. 

some questions can be open ended where the options array is a list with 0 entries and the answer is a string

make sure to do some quality control on the question and answers so that they are correct and not just ai generated slop that doesnt make sense or isnt right.
