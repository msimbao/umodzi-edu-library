follow this format to make a model examination council of zambia test: dictionary with the following keys and variable types: id (string), title (string), subject (string), grade (number), cost (number), description (string), difficulty (string), totalQuestions (number), estimatedTime (number), link (string), questions (array of dictionaries).

the id should be a unique string made by combining the date first three letters of subject grade and number after a dash if making multiple dictionaries e.g 20252107MATG7_1

the title should be short and concise and unique but simple like "sample test 1" or the one word that is the of the central topic covered. so even the test can be a mix of questions from different topics or one central topic in that syllabus

the link should be a url that is: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msimbao/umodzi-edu-library/refs/heads/main/tests/grade{grade}/{subject}/files/{id}.json" where {grade} {subject} and {id} are the ones you will put in the dictionary. Make sure that the subject is written in full

Questions should be an array of dictionaries with keys and types: id (question number starting at 1 if it is a question, if it is a non_question like a section give it a name), question (string), options (array of strings), image( can be blank or a string of a prompt of an image that should be there),answer (number index of correct answer or string with correct answer), explanation (string). 

some questions should have the keys non_question=true if they are not questions but instead intermission sections explaining what questions are up next or the comprehension passage before a set of follow up questions. These questions should not count towards the total question count when you are making them and their ids will just be a name.

some questions are follow up quesitons that need to follow each other or follow the comprehension passage and should have the key follow_up=true

if you need to make some parts bold, put the words between double asterisks, e.g **Bold text**. If you need to underline some words, put the words between double bottom dashes, e.g __underline__. If you need to make a blank space, use 3 dots, e.g ...

the first question should always be a non_question with the summary of the quiz you are about to take.

some questions can be open ended where the options array is a list with 0 entries and the answer is a string

make sure to do some quality control on the question and answers so that they are correct and not just ai generated slop that doesnt make sense or isnt right.

some questions can be short form answer where the options array is a list with 0 entries and the answer is a string with a single word. make sure the question is written so that the answer is only and can only be a single word and the question should lead the student to say that. if you can't think of a quesiton that should only have 1 strict answer dont make that question

make sure that the options key will always be there for questions even if the array must be empty

also follow the optional settings below:

should images be generated: no
should short form answers be generated: yes
