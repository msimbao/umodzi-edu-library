      "question": "**TEXT 2: The Lost Puppy**\n\nRead the passage below and answer questions 53-57. \n\nLast Saturday morning, eight-year-old Chanda was playing in her yard when she heard a soft whimpering sound coming from behind the house. She followed the sound and found a small, brown puppy hiding under a bush. The puppy looked scared and hungry.\n\nChanda carefully picked up the puppy and took it inside to show her mother. 'Mum, can we keep it?' she asked hopefully. Her mother examined the puppy and noticed it was wearing a collar with a name tag that read 'Simba.' She explained to Chanda that the puppy belonged to someone else and they needed to find its owner.\n\nThey decided to walk around the neighbourhood asking people if they had lost a puppy. After visiting several houses, they met Mr. Mwanza, who lived three streets away. When he saw Simba, his face lit up with joy. 'Thank you so much!' he said. 'Simba has been missing since yesterday. My children have been crying all night.'\n\nChanda felt happy that she had helped reunite Simba with his family, even though she was a little sad to say goodbye. Mr. Mwanza thanked Chanda by giving her a box of chocolates and promising to visit with Simba soon.\n\n",

      "question": "**TEXT 3: Traditional Zambian Games**\n\nRead the passage below and answer questions 59-61.\n\nZambia has many traditional games that children have enjoyed for hundreds of years. One popular game is called 'Nsolo,' which is played with small stones or seeds on a wooden board with holes. Players take turns moving the stones around the board following special rules. The player who captures the most stones wins the game.\n\nAnother favorite game is 'Hide and Seek,' known locally as 'Chiselu.' Children take turns hiding while one person counts and then tries to find all the hidden players. This game helps children develop their problem-solving skills and learn to work as a team.\n\n'Rope skipping' or 'Ukujumpa' is especially popular among girls. They use ropes made from plant fibers or rubber and create songs to sing while jumping. Some girls can jump for many minutes without stopping, showing great skill and coordination.\n\nThese traditional games are important because they bring children together, teach them valuable life skills, and help preserve Zambian culture. Unfortunately, many children today prefer modern games and computers, so some traditional games are being forgotten. Parents and teachers are working hard to make sure these games continue to be played by future generations.\n\n",
